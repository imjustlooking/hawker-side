# Hawker(side)Pay by Gabriel Lu & Nikita


Introduction
------
HawkerPay is a two-part app which aims to streamline the food order and collection process in Singaporean hawker stalls.

As mentioned previously, this app is two-part, one being the user interface, the other being the hawker interface (which is what this app is).

Hawker(side)Pay and HawkerPay connect to a common database, where the apps let both the patron and the hawker to interact with each other.
